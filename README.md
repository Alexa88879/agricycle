# AgriCycle ‚ôªÔ∏è üöú

**AgriCycle** is a mobile application built with Flutter that aims to revolutionize agricultural waste management. It provides a platform for farmers to connect with businesses, enabling the efficient sale, purchase, and recycling of agricultural waste. The app also features market trend analysis for agricultural commodities and an AI-powered waste classification tool.

## üåü Key Features

* **User Roles:** Separate interfaces and functionalities for Farmers and Businesses (Companies).
* **Waste Listing:** Farmers can list their agricultural waste products with details like type, quantity, location, and images.
* **Browse & Discover:** Businesses can browse and search for available waste listings.
* **Direct Connection:** Facilitates communication or contact between farmers and interested businesses (details on implementation may vary).
* **AI Waste Classification:** Users can upload images of waste, and an AI model (Python backend) classifies the type of waste.
* **Market Trends:** Provides insights into market prices and trends for various agricultural products to help farmers and businesses make informed decisions.
* **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using Firebase.
* **Dashboard:** Personalized dashboards for farmers and businesses to manage their listings, activities, and view relevant information.
* **My Listings:** Farmers can view and manage the waste they have listed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend (Mobile App):**
    * Flutter & Dart
    * Provider (for state management)
    * Firebase SDKs (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
    * `http` (for network requests to the backend)
    * `image_picker` (for selecting images)
    * `fl_chart` (for displaying market trend charts)
* **Backend (Waste Classification Service):**
    * Python
    * Flask (for creating the API)
    * TensorFlow/Keras (or other ML library for the classification model - *inferred*)
    * Pillow (for image manipulation)
* **Database & Backend Services:**
    * Firebase Firestore (for data storage)
    * Firebase Authentication (for user management)
    * Firebase Storage (for storing images)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* Firebase Account: [Create a Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/)
* Python environment for the backend service.
* An editor like VS Code or Android Studio.

### Frontend Setup (Flutter App)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/agricycle.git](https://github.com/your-username/agricycle.git)
    cd agricycle
    ```
2.  **Set up Firebase:**
    * Create a new Firebase project.
    * Add an Android and/or iOS app to your Firebase project.
    * Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and place it in `android/app/`.
    * Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS and place it in `ios/Runner/`.
    * Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).
    * Set up Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage with appropriate security rules. (Refer to `firebase_rules/` for examples, but ensure they are secure for production).

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Backend Setup (Waste Classifier Service)

1.  **Navigate to the service directory:**
    ```bash
    cd waste_classifier_service
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Prepare your Machine Learning Model:**
    * The `app.py` expects a trained model file (e.g., `waste_model.h5` or similar). You'll need to train your waste classification model and place it in the `waste_classifier_service` directory or update the path in `app.py`.
    * Ensure you have a `labels.txt` file if your model requires one for class names.

5.  **Run the Flask server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    By default, it might run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

6.  **Configure Flutter App to connect to Backend:**
    * In your Flutter code (likely in `lib/screens/waste_classification_screen.dart` or a service file), update the API endpoint to point to your running Flask server. If running on a local machine and testing with an emulator/device, you might need to use your machine's local IP address instead of `127.0.0.1`. For Android emulators, `10.0.2.2` usually maps to the host machine's localhost.

## üí° How to Use

1.  **Sign Up/Login:** Create an account or log in if you already have one.
2.  **Select Role:** Choose whether you are a "Farmer" or a "Company/Business".
